## Installation
To install the chatbot, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Create a Telegram bot and obtain the token for the bot.
4. Create a Whatsapp bot and obtain the credentials for the bot.
5. Update the configuration file config.json with the credentials for both the bots.
6. Run the main.py file to start the chatbot.
